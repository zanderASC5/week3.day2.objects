 * 3) Give this div a class of "hero_text_container".
 * 
 * 4) Loop through the hero object (this cannot be done like an array)
 * HINT: you can get all of the keys for an object using 
 * `Object.keys(targetObject)`, which returns an array of just the keys.
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
 * NOTE: the array of keys from `Object.keys()` are strings. So, 
 * you can then loop through that array and get the value using square
 * bracket notation (NOT dot notation)
 * 
 * 5) For each key/value pairing in the hero object, create a new `p`
 * element and append it to the div you made in step #2
 * 
 * The text inside each `p` element should be in the form of the 
 * key followed by a ": " followed by the value for the key.
 * For example:
 * "name: sombra"
 * 
 * For the "abilities" key, the value is not a string, but an array,
 * so we'll have to treat it differently.
 * While looping, you can check to see if the value is an array using
 * Array.isArray(value)
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray
 * 
 * Instead of the value, use a call to the method "getAbilityString()", 
 * providing the array as an argument. We'll make this next!

// BONUS: Currently, the ".createInfoDivonly()" method adds every
// key + value in one string to each `p` element, which makes it hard 
// to style one and not the other.
// Modify the ".createInfoDivonly()" method to ignore the "img" key and 
// allow for differential CSS styling betwee the key and value

// BONUS: In order to include each ability's description, include a
// tooltip that will appears on "mouseover"
// You'll have to modify the .getAbilityString() method and include
// the appropriate CSS
